This project will provide a starting point for all freecodecamp projects.  I am intentionally doing these projects inside of git repos and codepen.io so that I practice good source control.  Here are my user Story requirements for this project template:

* It includes the testing suite available through freecodecamp:
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

* Transpiling for babel and SASS are done on everyreload and via a local server using webpack.  

Future enhancement may include the following:

* Writing basic units tests in Mocha and Chai.  (Testing how to write tests is pretty important)

* Add some framework pieces that make good sense for this.
